This repository contains two files:

run_analysis.R
CodeBook.md

## run_analysis.R

This R file carries out the following actions:

- Downloads the original dataset
- Merges the training and test data sets into a single data set
- Transforms the data set so it only contains the means and standard deviations for each measurement
- Applies meaningful names to the data set columns
- Labels the data with the correct activity names from the original set
- Creates a separate data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject

## CodeBook.MD

This text file contains details of the data, variables, transformations and other work carried out to produce the final data set.
